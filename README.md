# LeetCode
Solutions for LeetCode.

These solutions contains C, C++ and JAVA.
Most of them is C++, which I was learning when I started LeetCoding.

Because of the different languages, I push them in a JAVA project.
In the src files, there are hundreds of .java file.
The file name is "_" + the number of the problem + "_" + the title + ".java".
In each .java file, the structure is:

public class .java_name(the class's name) {

//  title 
    
    codes
    
}

Also, there may be some .java files which are for testing.
For example the Main.java and the TreeNode class used in the solutions.
